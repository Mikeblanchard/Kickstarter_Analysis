# **Kickstarter Challenge Analysis**

## This project was an extension of our analysis of Kickstarter campaigns for Louise, who is interested in Kickstaring a play.

#### Analysis and Challenges
The most difficult part of this analysis was choosing which data mattered. We had tons of data to refine, but decided to go in depth on comparing the success of Theater Play campaings to Launch Date and initial Goals.
